Yodaspeak Node.js demo app
--------------------------

This is not a serious application, I just wanted to mess around with Node.js, express, and some other NPM packages.

Using the Yodaspeak API
-----------------------
This uses the [Yoda Speak](https://www.mashape.com/ismaelc/yoda-speak) You need to grab your own key from [https://www.mashape.com](https://www.mashape.com). Once you have your key, copy the config/config.js.example file to config.js and replace the `key:` with your own unique API key to check it out.
